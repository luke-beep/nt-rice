## 💻 Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to customize my Windows NT system. This guide is not a step-by-step installation guide, but rather a list of the software and configurations I use to customize my system. It does not cover the installation of Windows NT, but rather the customization of an existing installation. It does not cover every single application and configuration, but rather the most important ones.
